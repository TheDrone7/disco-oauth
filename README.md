> An API client for Discord's OAuth2 to implement login and other discord api stuff to your website easily! As easy as a piece of pie ü•ß!

### Don't think so?
Well! We have got a basic code for you to do the job!
Make sure to make an app with discord [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) , add your domain/link for redirect of your app too!
For example, if your website is hosted on `https://localhost:3000` make sure to add a redirect as
`https://localhost:300/auth` if you're copying the below code!
